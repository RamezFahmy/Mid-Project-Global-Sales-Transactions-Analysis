## Data Cleaning Process

The cleaning process involved the following steps:

### Issues Addressed
1. **Birth Column**: Removed (derived from age)
2. **Data Type Conversions**: 
   - income, home_val, bluebook, oldclaim, clm_amt → Float
3. **Car Age Issues**: Removed negative values
4. **Categorical Formatting**: Cleaned z_score formatting from gender, education, occupation, car_type
5. **Missing Values**: Handled using KNN Imputation for:
   - yoj (Years on Job)
   - income
   - home_val
   - occupation
   - car_age

### Output
- **cleaned_df.csv**: Final cleaned dataset ready for analysis
