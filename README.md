##🧹 Data Cleaning Process
The dataset was prepared for analysis using the following steps:

###Cleaning Steps Applied

- Removed duplicate records
- Checked and verified missing values
- Converted date columns to datetime format
- Standardized column names for consistency
- Ensured numeric fields were properly formatted

----
**Output**
Cleaned dataset used for all analysis and visualizations
Verified dataset size and structure after cleaning

**🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The exploration phase included:

- Reviewing dataset structure and data types
- Generating summary statistics for numerical variables
- Analyzing categorical distributions:
- Sales channel distribution
- Regional distribution
- Product category distribution
This step ensured a clear understanding of data composition before performing business analysis.

**📈 Data Analysis**

The analysis focused on answering key business questions.

1️⃣ Sales by Product Category

- Aggregated total revenue by item type
- Identified top-performing product categories
- Highlighted revenue concentration patterns

2️⃣ Average Order Value (AOV) by Region

Calculated as:
**AOV = Total Revenue ÷ Number of Unique Orders**
- Compared purchasing behavior across regions
- Identified variation in average transaction size

3️⃣ Total Revenue Over Time

- Resampled data monthly
- Analyzed revenue trends and seasonality patterns

4️⃣ Total Profit by Region

- Aggregated total profit by region
- Identified most profitable markets
- Distinguished revenue performance from profitability

**🌐 Streamlit Web Application**

The project includes a multi-page interactive Streamlit application.
